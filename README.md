# Linked-Lists Project

### *Project Linked Lists* is a practice project to be able to manipulate linear data structure with nodes and pointers, and perform various methods/operations such as: node insertion, deletion, and finding specific nodes in the list.

### The following methods have been implemented into LinkedList class:

* append(value)  - Add a new node to the end of the list
* prepend(value) - Add a new node to the start of the list
* size() - Get total number of nodes in the list
* head() - Get first node of the list
* tail() - Get last node of the list
* at(index) - Find the node at the given index
* pop() - Remove last node from the list
* contains(value) - Returns true if the given value exists in the list
* find(value) - Returns an index of the node containing value
* toString() - Display nodes that are in the list in the string format
* insertAt(value, index) - Insert a new node with the provided value at given index
* removeAt(index) - Remove the node at the given index
